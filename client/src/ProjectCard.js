    title: 'Cyberbullying Detection using Deep Learning',
    description: 'The project aims to identify derogatory tweets on Twitter related to gender, race, or sexual orientation. It utilizes a dataset of 110,000 instances to explore various detection methods, including SVM, L2 regularization, random forest, BERT, and an ensemble of BERT and LSTM. Tweets are categorized into six groups: gender, age, religion, not cyberbullying, and ethnicity.',
